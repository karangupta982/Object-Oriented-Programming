why contructor is used or made?
Ans: like when user runs facebook app then user will not connect itself to server or database for fetching the data these functionality will be done automatically
when user runs the application. In constructor we initiate those methods which a user is not expected to do.


What is self?
Self is nothing but the object that we have created to access the attributes of class. We can verify by printing the id self and the object that 
we have created, id is nothing but the memory location where the object is located inside the RAM. If we create multiple object of a class then 
for every object there would be different memory locations of self for each object.


# in static setter method self is not required to be given because it is static no need of any dynamic value to be used

from outside we can not access parent overloaded methods using super keyword






1. Class and Obj (example)
2. Class has data/attribute and func/methods
    > Code walkthrough
    > attributes or contructor   get called itself, methods are called manually
3. Why Python is called OOP? - everything in Python is an object (data structure, data type etc)
4. Advantages of OOPS:
    > You can create your own datatype
    > code reusability
    > debugging
    > easy to colab


5. End to end Project (Chatbook class)
    > function vs method
    > magic method or dunder method
    > self
    > You can create attribute outside class as well

    > encapsulation
    > getter and setter
    > static method
